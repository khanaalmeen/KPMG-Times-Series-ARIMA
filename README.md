# KPMG-Times-Series-ARIMA
A time series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model can be a valuable tool for a pesticide manufacturing company operating in different states. By analyzing historical data on pesticide production, sales, and market trends, an ARIMA model can provide insights and predictions for future demand in specific states.

The ARIMA model takes into account the temporal dependencies and seasonality patterns in the data to forecast future values accurately. By examining factors such as agricultural seasons, weather conditions, and regulatory changes, the model can help the company optimize production planning, inventory management, and resource allocation.

Using the ARIMA model, the pesticide manufacturing company can anticipate fluctuations in demand, identify potential supply chain issues, and make informed decisions regarding production levels and distribution strategies in different states. This proactive approach allows the company to respond effectively to market dynamics, maximize operational efficiency, and maintain a competitive advantage in the pesticide industry.
